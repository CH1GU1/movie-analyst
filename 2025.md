# 2025 Changes

If you tried to run this application before some of these changes, you would have encountered some issues. The changes made in 2025 are meant to fix those issues and make the application run smoothly.

- Used `mysql2` instead of `mysql` for the API. See [this stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50093144/mysql-8-0-client-does-not-support-authentication-protocol-requested-by-server) for more information.

- Added an `init.sql` file to the API to create the database schema. This is needed because the application was not able to create the schema automatically.

- Fixed the logic used to select the correct API URL in the UI server.

- Added and fixed npm scripts in both the API and UI to make it easier to run the applications in development mode.

- Added some documentation to the README files to clarify the setup process.

- Added a `compose.yml` file to the API to make the application easier to run for the first time. This is essential for beginner DevOps and cloud engineers who don't have dev experience.
